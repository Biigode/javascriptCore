# JavaScript Core

This project is a comprehensive guide to JavaScript array methods and promises.

## Array Methods

JavaScript provides a rich set of built-in methods for manipulating arrays. In this project, we explore and explain each of these methods, including:

- `forEach`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
- `map`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.
- `filter`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- `reduce`: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.
- `find`: Returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
- `sort`: Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.
- `slice`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.
- `splice`: Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

For each method, we provide examples and explanations to help you understand their usage and benefits.

## Promises

Promises are a powerful feature in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. In this project, we cover the following topics related to promises:

- Creating and chaining promises.
- Handling promise rejections.
- Using `async/await` syntax for working with promises.
- Combining multiple promises using `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.

We provide code examples and explanations to guide you through the process of working with promises effectively.
